class A
{
String s = "AAA";

void methodA()
{
System.out.println(s);
}

static class B
{
void methodB()
{
methodA();
}
}
}

Answer:
The above code is incorrect as it holds the non static methodA() within nested static classB, it cannot be accessed directly. 
Outer class has to be instantiated first.
